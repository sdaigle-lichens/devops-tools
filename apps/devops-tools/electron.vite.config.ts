/**
 * `electron` must be externalized explicitly, via `rollupOptions.external`.
 *
 * `externalizeDepsPlugin` derives its externals from package.json `dependencies`, and `electron`
 * is a devDependency — correctly so, since the runtime comes from the Electron binary rather than
 * being shipped in the app. So the plugin does not cover it, and what then gets bundled is the
 * npm package's Node-side shim: a module whose entire body is `module.exports = getElectronPath()`,
 * resolving `path.txt` relative to `__dirname`. Inlined into `out/main/index.js` that runs at
 * import time, finds no `path.txt` beside the bundle, and throws "Electron failed to install
 * correctly, please delete node_modules/electron and try installing again" — which sends you off
 * to reinstall node_modules for what is purely a bundling mistake. The app cannot start at all.
 *
 * The plugin's own `include` option is the documented lever for this and does NOT work here
 * (verified in maestro under vite 8.0.0 / electron-vite 4: it mutates `config.build` from inside
 * the `config` hook, and that no longer reaches the resolved ssr environment). Hence the direct
 * `external` below. `test/isolation.test.ts` asserts the built bundles import electron rather
 * than inlining the shim, because this failure is invisible until the app is launched.

/**
 * Runtime `dependencies`, externalized BY HAND — because `externalizeDepsPlugin` does not do it.
 *
 * Same vite 8 / electron-vite 4 bug as above, and it costs the whole plugin: it computes its
 * external list from `dependencies` and assigns `config.build` from inside the `config` hook,
 * which no longer reaches the resolved ssr environment. The list is simply dropped, and an empty
 * list is indistinguishable from an ignored one — which is exactly the state this app is in
 * today, with zero runtime `dependencies`. Derived from the manifest rather than listed here, so
 * the first dependency added tomorrow is external without anyone remembering this file. The regex
 * covers subpath imports (`<pkg>/extract`), which a bare name does not.
